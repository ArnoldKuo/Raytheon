Differences between MVL and main product (MeetingsCounter) are that the MVL was more of an approximation, 
since it used a mathematical based approach. The main product was more accurate using the Java Calendar
library, which takes into account for leap years and such. MVL can also only take in one date at a time 
in the txt file whereas the main product can take in as many dates as possible each line.
